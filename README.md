# Some info:
* In this repo, I and hopefully *you* will try to make a game together.
* *We* will be using the SDL2 library and *we*'ll write in in C.
* It will be fun and exciting.
* *We*'re going to need art and music. I might beg bernds for it, or I just might take some public domain stuff and use those.
* This will be one of my first big projects. I have next to zero experience.
* It's probably going to suck, but it will be a learning experience.
* Whatever comes from this, whether good or bad, it will be limited strictly to the kc audience. I don't have any big aspirations here.
* If you want to participate, leave a message on one of the commits or just start editing code right away. Thanks!
