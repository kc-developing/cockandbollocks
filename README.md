# Main info:
* In this repo, I and hopefully you will try to make a game together.
* **We** will be using the SDL2 library and **we**'ll write in in C.
* It will be fun and exciting.
* **We**'re going to need art and music. I might beg bernds for it, or I just might take some public domain stuff and use those.
* Thi is one of my first big projects. I barely even know how git works.
* Whatever comes from this, whether good or bad, it will be limited strictly to the kc audience. I don't have any big aspirations here.
* It's probably going to suck, but it will be a learning experience.
