So, I've been slacking off at working on this due to lack of ideas, time and motivation. However, it seems like this situation will be changing soon. This will be the first gamedev project of my life. That being the case, it would be very hard to do this on my own. Plus, one of the reasons why I decided to do this is to gitgud at collaborative projects.

So, if you can, please please please help. It will be fun, I promise.
